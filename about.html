  <h1>Why I Built CalmTeen</h1>

  <p>CalmTeen was born from chaos — a version of me who was addicted, distracted, and lost. I was tired of feeling powerless.</p>

  <p>This site is my system to fight back — to focus, discipline myself, and take full control of my life. It’s more than a project. It’s my comeback story.</p>
